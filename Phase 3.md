# Phase 3: Threat Detection & Incident Analysis
Author: Aleksandra Bathelt

### How does this phase apply to security?
Threat detection is a core responsibility of SOC analysts and cybersecurity professionals. Understanding how to detect and analyze attacks is crucial for identifying malicious activity before it escalates into a full-blown incident.
<br>
This phase focuses on security alerts, network attack techniques, and log analysis, teaching you how to investigate security events and recognize attack patterns.

### How to break down this phase
To get the most out of this phase, break it down into three parts:
1. **Alerts & Incident Identification** â†’ Understand the difference between events, alerts, and true incidents. Learn about false positives vs false negatives and how to prioritize alerts in a SOC.
2. **Network Attacks & Threat Hunting** â†’ Learn about common network-based attacks (scanning, exploits, lateral movement, DDoS, etc.) and how to detect them using PCAP analysis, Zeek, and Suricata.
3. **Web Security & Log Analysis** â†’ Learn how to analyze logs from web servers, firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoints to detect attack patterns.

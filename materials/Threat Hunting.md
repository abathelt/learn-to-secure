# Topic 3: Therat Hunting
Threat hunting is not just about using specific tools, but about having a strong foundation in fundamental technical skills. This includes: 
- Endpoint Analysis
- Network Analysis 
- Log Analysis
- Understanding Malware

### Attack-Based Hunting (ABH)
Has ... happened on my network?
1. What am I looking for?
2. Where am I likely to find it?
3. How can I manipulate the data to see it?




### Threat Hunting concepts you should know
- What is the difference between threat hunting and threat detection?
- Why is threat hunting considered proactive instead of reactive?
- What is the difference between TTP-based hunting and indicator-based hunting?
- How do you identify lateral movement in a network?
- What logs or artifacts can help detect persistence techniques used by attackers?
- What are some signs of Command & Control (C2) communication?
- How can you use DNS logs to detect exfiltration or tunneling?
- How would you detect a malicious PowerShell script running on an endpoint?
- How do you identify beaconing behavior from malware using network logs?
- What are some indicators of credential dumping (e.g., Mimikatz activity)?
- What logs would you analyze to detect a brute-force attack against Active Directory?
- How can you differentiate a legitimate admin login from an attackerâ€™s lateral movement?
- What techniques can attackers use to bypass logging and detection, and how can you detect them?

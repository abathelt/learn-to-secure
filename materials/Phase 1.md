# Phase 0: Starting from zero

### How does this phase apply to security?
Before diving into cybersecurity, it's crucial to understand the foundational IT concepts that security professionals work with daily. Without these basics, security threats and defenses wonâ€™t make sense. This phase covers computer systems, networking, operating systems, scripting, and virtualizationâ€”all essential for an entry-level cybersecurity role.

### How to break down this phase
